# Waker (*Currently in progress*)
An alarm made for iOS built with Swift and in Xcode. The main idea of the application is to have a small task to complete to be able to turn off the alarm. This will encourage for some brain activity when you wake up. Currently, the alarm screen is almost fully designed. I'm looking into how the alarm will fire as there are complexities with Apple allowing applications to set alarms will in the background or not active. The design for the alarm is mostly being focused on the iPhone 6 screen.

## Planned Feature
- A small task to complete before alarm turns off
- Display amount of time until you have to wake up
- Notifies you when you should be going to sleep based on alarm
- Records your sleep duration and graphs it with other in the week
- Notifies you when your amount of sleep has been going down
- Gradually increase the sound of the alarm at the set time
